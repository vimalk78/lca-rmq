## Algorithm for the Least Common Ancestor problem.

This implements LCA with "Range Minimum Queries" as described in the paper "The LCA Problmem Revisited".

https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/261/BenFar-LCA-00.pdf

**Completed** : Naive RMQ, Faster RMQ (using nlogn sparse table)

**TODO** : Implement Â±1 RMQ

### Naive RMQ output :
